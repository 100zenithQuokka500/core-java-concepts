## Layered Architecture

Layered architecture is a design pattern where an application is organized into horizontal layers, each layer performing a specific role within the application. This approach allows for separation of concerns, improving maintainability and scalability.

Presentation Layer: Manages user interface and user interaction.

Business Logic Layer: Contains the business logic and rules.

Data Access Layer: Responsible for accessing data sources, such as databases.

Cross-Cutting Concerns: Like logging, security, and transaction management, are often handled in separate layers.

Layered architecture promotes a clean separation of concerns and allows for changes in one layer without affecting others.
