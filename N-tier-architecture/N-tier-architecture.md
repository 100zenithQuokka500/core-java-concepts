## N-Tier Architecture

N-tier architecture is a client-server architecture where the presentation, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated. It is typically used in enterprise applications to improve scalability, manageability, and flexibility.

Presentation Tier: The topmost level of the application, responsible for displaying information to the user and collecting user input.

Application Tier: Also known as the logic tier, it is responsible for processing user input, performing calculations, and making decisions.

Data Tier: Consists of a database and the data access layer. It is responsible for storing and retrieving data.

Each tier can be located on a separate machine or multiple machines, allowing the application to scale horizontally.
