## Interface 
interface has methods which are abstract and classes implement it. it provides 100% abstraction.it is used in design patterns 
to help define a clear contract and how different components should interact with each other.they define a common set of methods that multiple classes must implement.
it also allows multiple inheritance.

## Abstraction
it separates interface from its implementation. it focuses on important characteristics of object hiding the underlyng details that are not relevan to the user.t simplifies  the complexity and promotes reusablity of code.
